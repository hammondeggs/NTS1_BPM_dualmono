# NTS1_BPM_dualmono
BPM dual-mono delay for your KORG NTS-1 synthesizer

This is a (hopefully) well commented example of creating a BPM-style delay for your KORG NTS-1 synthesizer. The prologue and minilogue-xd synthesizers already come with this style of delay - yet the NTS-1 does not. 

This particular flavour of this delay is "dual mono" - this means, there are 2 identical delays, one for each channel. 


Place these files in your logue-sdk delfx\tests folder e.g.

```...logue-sdk\platform\nutekt-digital\delfx\tests\bpmdelay ```

Feel free to modify and create your own variations etc - try adding filters etc!

Have fun;
