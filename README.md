# NTS1_BPM_dualmono
BPM dual-mono delay for your KORG NTS-1 synthesizer

This is a (hopefully) well commented example of creating a BPM-style delay for your KORG NTS-1 synthesizer. The prologue and minilogue-xd synthesizers already come with this style of delay - yet the NTS-1 does not. 

This particular flavour of this delay is "dual mono" - this means, there are 2 identical delays, one for each channel.
